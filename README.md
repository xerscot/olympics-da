# EDA on Olympics Dataset

This project is to do a bit of Data Analysis in R with data from a sqlite database (hint it's included in the data folder)

## Description

Just before the Winter Olympics started the official site was still showing the summer games content. I built a scraper at the time in C# and cached the data to disk. With this project I'd like to explore the data I stored into a SQLite database (from my ETL project) using the R programming language.
